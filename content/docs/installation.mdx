Components are designed to be copied directly into your project.

## Prerequisites

## Adding a Component

1. Browse the component you want
2. Copy the code
3. Paste into `components/ui`
4. Install dependencies (if needed)
5. Import and use

## Example

```tsx
import { CreditCard } from '@/components/ui/credit-card';

export default function Page() {
  return <CreditCard />;
}
```

## Customization

All components are fully customizable:

- Change colors and styling
