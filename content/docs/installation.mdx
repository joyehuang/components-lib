## Installation

Components are designed to be copied directly into your project. Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following in your project:

- **React 19+**
- **Tailwind CSS 4+**
- **TypeScript** (recommended)

### Adding a Component

1. Browse the component you want to use
2. Copy the component code
3. Paste it into your `components/ui` directory
4. Install any required dependencies (listed in each component's documentation)
5. Import and use the component

### Example

```tsx
import { CreditCard } from '@/components/ui/credit-card';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CreditCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Customization

All components are fully customizable. Since you own the code, you can:

- Change colors and styling
- Modify animations
- Add or remove features
- Adapt to your design system

That's it! You're ready to start using components.
