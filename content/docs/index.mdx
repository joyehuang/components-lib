# Introduction

A curated collection of hand-crafted components that you can copy and paste into your projects. Each component is built with care, inspired by the best designs from around the web.

## Quick Start

Browse the components in the sidebar, preview them, and copy the code into your project. It's that simple.

```bash
# No installation needed
# Just copy and paste components
```

## Philosophy

Our approach is simple: **own your components**.

- **Copy & Paste** — Components are designed to be copied directly into your project
- **Customizable** — Every component is yours to modify
- **Learning-Focused** — Study the code and make it your own
- **No Lock-in** — Not tied to npm versions
