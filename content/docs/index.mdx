## Welcome to Components Library

This is a curated collection of hand-crafted components that you can copy and paste into your projects. Each component is built with care, inspired by the best designs from around the web.

## Philosophy

- **Copy & Paste**: Just like shadcn/ui, components are designed to be copied directly into your project
- **Customizable**: Every component is yours to modify and adapt
- **Learning-Focused**: Study the code, understand the patterns, and make it your own
- **No Package Lock-in**: Own your components, not tied to npm versions

## Current Components

- **3D Credit Card**: An interactive 3D credit card component with realistic animations
- **Simple Line Graph**: A clean, animated line chart component
- **Text Animations**: Various text animation effects for eye-catching typography

## Getting Started

Browse the components in the sidebar, preview them, and copy the code into your project. It's that simple.
